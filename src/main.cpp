Create a C++ program that implements a linked list. The linked list should be
a doubly linked list, allowing movement forward and backward. This program
should allow you to add and remove nodes from the list. Each node should
contain a reference to application data. The program does not have to provide
user interaction. Please include units tests for the program.
